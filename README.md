A CCCV (Constant Current, Constant Voltage) is ideal for small batteries. Initially, the battery is charged at Constant Current. When the battery is nearly full, its voltage reaches the Constant Voltage setting of the charger, and the current decays exponentially as the battery gets a finishing charge.

In this model I have build a CCCV charger on simulink that simulates this effect can be used to study and simulate this charging method maybe in a bigger system.
